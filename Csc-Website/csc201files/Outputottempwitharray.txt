You will be asked to fill 3 randomly sized arrays.

This array has 1 temperature(s).
please enter a temperature in this form 45 C
300 c
The values of temperature array one are 
300.0C
The average of temperature array one is 300.0C

This array has 4 temperature(s).
please enter a temperature in this form 45 C
122 f
please enter a temperature in this form 45 C
0 c
please enter a temperature in this form 45 C
100 c
please enter a temperature in this form 45 C
50 c
The values of temperature array two are 
122.0F, 0.0C, 100.0C, 50.0C
The average of temperature array two is 122.0F

This array has 3 temperature(s).
please enter a temperature in this form 45 C
212 f
please enter a temperature in this form 45 C
50 c
please enter a temperature in this form 45 C
32 f
The values of temperature array three are 
212.0F, 50.0C, 32.0F
The average of temperature array three is 122.0F

Here are the temperatures in the three arrays:
300.0C
122.0F, 0.0C, 100.0C, 50.0C
212.0F, 50.0C, 32.0F

An array with the largest values taken from the
3 arrays has 4 elements.
This solution knew the largest array of the three arrays:
300.0C, 50.0C, 100.0C, 50.0C

An array with the largest values taken from the
3 arrays has 4 elements.
This solution knew the largest size of the three arrays:
300.0C, 50.0C, 100.0C, 50.0C
